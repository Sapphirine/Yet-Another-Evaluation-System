First of all, it looked quite unflattering on me. The product description said, &#34;One size fits most,&#34; but no one ever told me it was made just for women. Secondly, I was surprised that when I put it on, I could still see my nipples. I didn't realize this of course until I was half way to the McDonalds in my matching g-string and lace gloves, when someone in a moving car yelled something about my nipples being the size of dinner plates. I had naturally assumed by the advertisement photo that this would somehow be covered up, but no! there were my big, pink chesticles for all to see. Sufficed to say, sitting in the McDonalds and devouring my five super sized Big Macs, I felt quite embarrassed.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2013", "summary": "Oh dear."}]
